# MyMemoryChat - Intelligent Data Chat System

Welcome to the MyMemoryChat GitHub organization! This repository houses the React client and Python server components for our advanced data chat system, powered by Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG) and Large Language Model (LLM) agents.

## Overview

This project provides a client-server architecture for a sophisticated chat application that leverages:

* **Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph-RAG):** Enhances LLM responses by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge graph.
* **LLM Agents:** Enables intelligent, autonomous interactions and task execution using search, update entities as well as read images tools.
* **Persistent Knowledge Graph:** Stores data into a Neo4j graph knowledge.
* **Interactive Chat Interface:** Offers a user-friendly experience for querying and interacting with data using the client.

Our system is designed to:

* Provide accurate, contextually relevant and positive responses.
* Automate data retrieval and updating tasks.
* Maintain a persistent record of user data.
* Offer a seamless and intuitive chat experience with a response time of around 5 seconds.

## Repositories

This organization contains the following repositories:

* **`LLM_agent`:**
    * Contains the backend server code, including the Graph-RAG pipeline, LLM agent logic, and knowledge graph integration.
    * [See here](https://github.com/MyMemoryChat/LLM_agent)
* **`[client-repository-name]`:**
    * Contains the frontend client application, providing the user interface for chat interaction.
